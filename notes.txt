* interfaces must derive from IUnknown
  compiler does special things to create COM compatible interface for IUnknown

* on mac the iid in queryinterface is passed by value
  D's x64 calling convention is not consistent with extern(C) when passing structs by values

* mac uuids are big endian

* on osx methods must be marked extern(C)
  by default D compiler makes COM methods extern(Windows)
  extern(System) => extern(C) on Mac and extern(Windows) on Windows

* build the Mac dispatch library
  g++ -m32 -g -c DeckLinkAPIDispatch.cpp
  ar rvs libDeckLinkAPI.a DeckLinkAPIDispatch.o 

* build glfw3 for 32-bit
  clone from https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
  cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1 -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=i386
  make -j8
  make install

* build derelict3
  clone from https://github.com/aldacron/Derelict3
  open Derelict3/build/build.d
  find the line "enum compilerOptions = "-lib -O -release -inline -property -w -wi";"
  add "-m32" to the flags
  compile build script with "dmd build.d"
  run "./build"
