* interfaces must derive from IUnknown
  compiler does special things to create COM compatible interface for IUnknown

* on mac the iid in queryinterface is passed by value
  D's x64 calling convention is not consistent with extern(C) when passing structs by values so 64-bit doesn't work on Macs.

* mac uuids are big endian

* on osx methods must be marked extern(C)
  by default D compiler makes COM methods extern(Windows)
  extern(System) => extern(C) on Mac and extern(Windows) on Windows
